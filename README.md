This is the source code for the page https://hariharanjayashankar.github.io/. It's largely based on the template of [Academic-Hugo](https://themes.gohugo.io/academic/).

The way one executes the changes made here are:
1. Save all the files after the changes are made
2. Make sure that in ./config/_default/config.toml the publishDir is set to the folder you want hugo to build to
2. In the terminal, enter "hugo" to compile to the publishDir
2. Push the publishDir folder to github and wait for github pages to deploy it.
2. Don't forget to push the source code as well for maintenance
